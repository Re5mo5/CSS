        Neuvillette is the Iudex of Fontaine, and the leader of the Marechaussee Phantom. While Neuv
        illette upholds the rules of the court with utmost reverence, he is quite aloof when dealing with human emotions and often distances himself from the public eye.<br><p></p>
        Despite his human appearance, he is actually the Hydro Dragon Sovereign. However, 
        he did not obtain full dragonhood until the events of Archon Quest Chapter IV: Act V - 
        Masquerade of the Guilty when the Hydro Archon Focalors returned the powers stolen by the Heavenly Principles from the Sovereigns back to him.</h2></div>
